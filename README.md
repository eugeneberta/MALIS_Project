# MALIS_Project
Repository for the MALIS course project, EURECOM, Fall Semester 2020/2021, Eug√®ne Berta &amp; Patrick Iversenc

* The repo Datasets/ contains all the files we used to train our deep learning algorithm.

* The repo Reports/ contains our three reports for the project and the images we used in this reports.

* The repo Silhouette_Generator/ was provided by Smartpixels, it contains every file necessary to run the Silhouette Generator.

* The repo masks/ contains binary masks, outputs for part1 and inputs for part2 of the project.

* The repo unlabeled_dataset/ contains image files only, from which we built our segmented datasets.

* The file MALIS_Project_Part_1 can be openned in Google Colab, it implements the first part of our project (image segmentation with deep learning).

* The file MALIS_Project_Part_2 can be ran on a local machine, connected via http to the silhouette generator, it implements the second part of our project (pose estimation with gradient descent).
